These are some sample model parameter sets.  They were trained from pairwise alignments with human chromosome 22 as described in the paper.  They were produced using 

context/test/scripts/f84test.sh

which was also used for the JCB paper data.  

Four sets of parameters are included for each species:
_sf84_djc : Felsenstien 84 substitution model with Jukes Cantor context dependence model
_sf84: Felsenstein 84 subsitution model with *no* context dependence
_sjc_djc : Jukes Cantor substitution model with Jukes Cantor context dependence model
_sjc : Jukes Cantor substitution model with *no* context dependence
